# CurvedGCode-to-ABB
Converts Curved GCode (G02,G03) to MoveC instructions in ABB RAPID program

A simple way to 3D concrete or other large structures is to repurpose a robot arm into a 3D printer. 
Ordinary 3D printer slices can be used to create machine tools paths that extrude layers of the print. 
However many robot arms can not handle the sharp short movements generated by the linear G code movements especially those used for curved sections of print. 
The solution is to use the inbuilt curved movement functions of the robot arm to smooth out the motion. 
However curved G code uses a start point, destination point and radius point to define curved movements. https://www.cnccookbook.com/cnc-g-code-arc-circle-g02-g03/
And the MoveC instructions in ABB RAPID Programming uses a start point, destination point and mid point in the arc between the start and destination point.
