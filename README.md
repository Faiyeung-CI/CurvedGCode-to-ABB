GCode_to_Robtargets v2.py converts Curved GCode (G02,G03) to MoveC instructions in ABB RAPID program

A simple way to 3D print concrete or other large structures is to repurpose a robot arm into a 3D printer. 
Ordinary 3D printer slicers can be used to create machine tools paths that extrude layers of the print. 
However many robot arms can not handle the sharp short movements generated by the linear G code movements especially those used for curved sections of print. 
The solution is to use the inbuilt curved movement functions of the robot arm to smooth out the motion. 
However curved G code uses a start point, destination point, radius point and whether the motion is anti-clockwise or clockwise to define curved movements. https://www.cnccookbook.com/cnc-g-code-arc-circle-g02-g03/
And the MoveC instructions in ABB RAPID Programming uses a start point, destination point and mid point in the arc between the start and destination point.

GCode_to_Robtargets v2.py converts Curved GCode (G02,G03) (.gcode file) to MoveC and MoveL instructions in ABB RAPID program. It was adapted from from Daniel Aguirre (https://github.com/DAguirreAg/GCode-to-ABB) linear Gcode translation to ABB RAPID programming instructions. 
test_robprogramSim.txt can be copied and pasted into a RAPID program. 
Alternatively, the contents of test_moveLsSim.txt and test_robtargetsSim can be pasted into a RAPID program. test_robtargetsSim being the position constants for the program test_moveLsSim.txt. 

Calc_Arc_Midpoint.py is used to test out the
